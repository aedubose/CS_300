# CS_300

BEing able to create a program that allows users the ability to sign up for a course using a interface and software when enrolling for a course of their selection. I approached the problem by utilizing all structures to create a flexiable software program and functional code. After numerous problems that I have encountered throughout this course Ive decided to do additional research in the functions and structures to help me understand how they are used and when to use them.

I plan to use the structures in the future to help solve problems that other companies might have. This program has helped me understand logically and able to write functional code and to keep the coding ethics all around.
